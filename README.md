## Variant 1

This variant of Tic-Tac-Toe is a straightforward implementation where two players take turns marking spaces on the board in the form of row and column (e.g., 1 2) to make a move.

## Variant 2

This variant introduces a computer opponent with a simple strategy. The computer aims to make winning moves or block the opponent from winning. Players must enter a number (1-9) representing spaces on the board.

## Variant 3

This variant is similar to variant 2, but here two players play the game instead of a computer on the other end.
